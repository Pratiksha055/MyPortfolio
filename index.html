        <h3>SkyNote-Weather App</h3>
        <p>
            The SkyNote app is a simple and responsive weather web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It also supports automatic weather detection based on the user's current location using the Geolocation API.
        </p>
        <p>
            This weather app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches and displays weather data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. The app features a clean UI, error handling for invalid input, and supports both manual search and automatic location-based weather fetching.

        <h3>DreamScape Explorer</h3>
        <p>
        DreamScape Explorer is an AI-powered travel inspiration app that helps users discover the world‚Äôs most iconic destinations with just a single search. By entering any city or country, the app instantly generates a curated list of the ten most famous landmarks or attractions, complete with concise explanations of why they are worth visiting. It blends real-time validation of user input with the power of Google‚Äôs Gemini AI model to ensure accurate, meaningful results presented in a simple and elegant interface.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party APIs, handle error states gracefully, and design user-friendly front-end experiences. With thoughtful features like input validation, custom error handling, and dynamic content rendering, DreamScape Explorer reflects both my technical skills in JavaScript and my focus on delivering polished, reliable user experiences.

        <h3>Assembly-Endgame</h3>
        <p>
        I built this project as part of the Scrimba course ‚ÄúLearn React‚Äù, which provided the full game logic and design. This project helped me apply key React concepts in a real, hands-on way.
        </p>
        <p>
        Assembly: Endgame is a word-guessing game where your mission is to save the programming world from Assembly. With each incorrect guess, a popular programming language is eliminated. Once all are gone‚ÄîAssembly wins.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of React fundamentals, including state management with hooks, conditional rendering, and component-based structure. I also gained experience working with responsive CSS and third-party libraries like React Confetti. While the logic were provided by Scrimba, building and experimenting with this project helped solidify my ability to read, understand, and run real-world React code.

        <h3>Personal Finance Tracker</h3>
        <p>
        Personal Finance Tracker is a simple and intuitive web application built with React that helps users take control of their finances. The app allows users to add income and expense entries, view a running total of their finances, and set a personal savings goal. As users track their earnings and spending, the app calculates their net balance and visually shows progress toward their savings goal with a dynamic progress bar.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project focuses on clean UI/UX design, interactive features, and real-time state management using React‚Äôs useState hook. It‚Äôs structured with reusable, modular components and styled using vanilla CSS for responsiveness across devices.

        <h3>GrowingSnake- FunGame</h3>
        <p>
            This is a fully responsive, browser-based implementation of the classic Snake game, built using HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The game grid is dynamically calculated to adapt to different screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices. The logic handles directional control, collision detection, dynamic food placement, and real-time snake movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            It features a glowing, animated snake head, sound effects triggered by game events (eating, game over, win), and high score tracking via localStorage. The game loop runs using setInterval, and includes clean separation of concerns across HTML, CSS, and JS for maintainability and scalability. A win condition is implemented when the snake fills all available grid cells, triggering a celebratory sound and message.
